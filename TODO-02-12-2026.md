# TODO for Today

## UI and Interaction
- [ ] Visually confirm right-side green buttons do not overlap content at common desktop widths.
- [ ] Verify right-side button text remains centered on desktop and mobile.
- [ ] Confirm `Value Type` and `Currency Code` alignment in Chrome and Safari.
- [ ] Validate matching font size for `Revenue`, `Cost Savings`, and currency dropdown text.

## Executive Impact Analysis
- [ ] Test single-item mode: verify each executive tab references one initiative name in bold.
- [ ] Test multi-item mode: verify comparative section includes bold initiative names and role-specific tradeoff implications.
- [ ] Confirm selected comparison options drive comparative analysis scope.

## Data and Inputs
- [ ] Validate salary type checkbox toggle (`Annual` / `Hourly`) updates visible input group correctly.
- [ ] Validate currency code list includes `Other` and behaves correctly in calculations and output.
- [ ] Confirm annualized estimate updates on weekly value and currency changes.

## Quality and Validation
- [ ] Run `npm run validate:ui` and capture pass output in notes.
- [ ] Run `npm run test` and confirm no regressions.
- [ ] Do one manual end-to-end run with `Autofill 3 Demo Projects`.

## Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update README section for new input controls (initiative type, value type, currency code, salary type checkboxes).
- [ ] Add one short changelog entry summarizing today’s UI and executive analysis updates.
- [ ] Capture one screenshot of final UI state for baseline reference.
